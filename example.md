## Abstract

A robot system that includes a robot and a remote station. The robot and remote station contain monitors, cameras, speakers and microphones that allow for two-way videoconferencing between a physician at the remote station and a patient in the vicinity of the robot. The system also includes a patient monitor that displays patient information such as an x-ray. The patient monitor can be seen by the patient, and by the physician through the robot camera. The system allows for a physician to remotely review the medical information with the patient.
